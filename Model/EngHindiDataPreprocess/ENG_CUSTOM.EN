Just because a crosswalk looks like a hopscotch board doesn 't mean it is one
Look both ways before you cross the street
Have you read the help file?
Odessa is a better game. Really.
Tourniquets are not recommended unless in the direst emergency
I could sure use a backrub right about now...
Monitors won 't give you Vitamin D - - but sunlight will...
If you 're ever lost and alone in the woods, hug a tree
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
Consistency is key
When without a stapler, a staple and a ruler will work
Never blow in a dog 's ear

Just because a crosswalk looks like a hopscotch board doesn 't mean it is one
Look both ways before you cross the street
Have you read the help file?
Odessa is a better game. Really.
Tourniquets are not recommended unless in the direst emergency
I could sure use a backrub right about now...
Monitors won 't give you Vitamin D - - but sunlight will...
If you 're ever lost and alone in the woods, hug a tree
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
Consistency is key
When without a stapler, a staple and a ruler will work
Never blow in a dog 's ear

Look both ways before you cross the street
Have you read the help file?
Odessa is a better game. Really.
Tourniquets are not recommended unless in the direst emergency
I could sure use a backrub right about now...
Monitors won 't give you Vitamin D - - but sunlight will...
If you 're ever lost and alone in the woods, hug a tree
Fishing wire makes bad dental floss
Consistency is key
When without a stapler, a staple and a ruler will work
Never blow in a dog 's ear
